mvc-fun
=======

An mvc based framework for creating huge application servers with fun.

Whereas basic webserver features are included, this framework is more about giving a development structure following the mvc pattern thn providing features like express does. You can, however, use express on top of it to create a webserver using the mvc-pattern and/or any template engine.

For simple projects the provided features of mvc-fun should be enough.

features
--------

- Full MVC structure given in a cool way.
- POST parameters as well as query string parsing directly included.
- RESTful services included.
- Simply extendable with other standard frameworks around.
